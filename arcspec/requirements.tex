\section{Requirements}\label{sec:requirements}

While researching older attempts at a similar implementation, we discovered a plethora of different directions that had been already studied in some way but all in the end failed at having a long term impact. The biggest issue with these other attempts was that they were not implemented with the objective of being supported long term and thus did not care themselves with maintainability issues, for example mitigating the risk of breaking with new updates of either libraries or Unity or having a scalable architecture.

As we use most of previous work to understand what the workbench's requirements are, we expand mostly on the non functional requirements exactly to avoid the faith of those previous attempts, focusing mostly on maintainability and performance, as those will determine the long term support and success of our approach.

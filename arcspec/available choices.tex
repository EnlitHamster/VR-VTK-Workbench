\section{Available Choices}\label{sec:available-choices}

There a number of potential architectural choices we can make to tackle the requirements of the system. In particular, there are a number of pain points that the architecture needs to address in order for the system to be effective and enabling long term support. We will discuss these pain points and the available choices, their pros and cons and how each tackles some or all of the requirements.

\paragraph{Unity integration} The first issue we need to discuss is how to connect our solution to Unity. Two possibilities are available to us, that is a C\# plugin for Unity which directly integrates with the engine, also known as Managed Plugin \cite{UnityMan17}, or a native library, in our case preferably in C++ as VTK is written in it, also known as Native Plugin \cite{UnityMan17}.

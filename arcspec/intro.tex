This is the Architectural Specification document. This documentation presents different view points on how the VR VTK Workbench is built, in particular focusing on the components and their interactions. This document also presents the interface for the different components and thus should be used as reference for any development on the plugin as well as of any toolbox UI component. 

Section \ref{sec:requirements} describes the requirements, especially non-functional ones, of the system and how these impact the architectural choice. In particular, it will focus on three main factors guiding the choice based on the requirements: decoupling, maintenance and performance. Section \ref{sec:available-choices} describes the evaluated architectures and their evolution over time, with their pros and cons. Section \ref{sec:selected-architecture} describes the selected architecture for the system and goes into detail on the components, how they interact and why and how they satisfy the requirements.

\paragraph{Belleman (2003) \cite{belleman_interactive_2003}} the text provides the definition and characterisation of immersive VR environments. It explicitly describes which features it should or should not have and their performances in order to be classified as good. The most important way described in the text to immerse the user inside the environment is by the means of interaction. It then focuses on describing how such environments are achievable using VTK. It also highlights the performance issues with the given solution. Finally, a way to port 2D environments to 3D immersive ones is proposed.

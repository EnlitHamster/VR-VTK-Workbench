We will present here a summary of our literature survey. We started from Wheeler et al's proposal \cite{wheeler_virtual_2018} and from a number of bachelor's theses \cite{dreuning_visual_2016, kruis_creating_2017, shutte_virtual_2018} and then explored backwards their citations. Furthermore, we searched for papers bearing keywords of interest to our work (i.e. VTK Unity integration, VR visualization environment, etc). 

As this topic is still young (most relevant papers were published in the past five years), our literature is quite limited, but we make our case for the importance of this work based on multiple papers that show the importance of visualization toolkits for specialist that have little to no technical knowledge. Based on this, we use what little attempts have already been made and we argue our work is significant to a number of fields.

%% Subsequently we argue the importance of our work based on the literature
We divide this discussion in two sections. First we summarise the most relevant (groups of) papers in a annotated bibliography fashion. Subsequently we show which gaps our work will fill.
